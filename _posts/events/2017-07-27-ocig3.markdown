This was the third virtual meeting for members of the openCypher Implementers Group, with the aim of discussing, agreeing upon or rejecting Cypher language changes proposed via Cypher Improvement Requests (<a href="https://github.com/opencypher/openCypher/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ACIR" target="_blank">CIRs</a>) and Improvement Proposals (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/cips/" target="_blank">CIPs</a>).

The agenda focused on adding support for control over pattern matching 'morphism', and graph addressing.

Additionally, there are interesting discussions in ISO and the LDBC Query Language Task Force around graph querying, which are relevant for the openCypher community.
An important aspect of these discussions is the relationship between SQL and a native property graph query language like Cypher.
These topics were also discussed at the meeting.
