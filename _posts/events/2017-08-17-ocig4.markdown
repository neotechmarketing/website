This was the fourth virtual meeting for members of the openCypher Implementers Group, with the aim of discussing, agreeing upon or rejecting Cypher language changes proposed via Cypher Improvement Requests (<a href="https://github.com/opencypher/openCypher/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ACIR" target="_blank">CIRs</a>) and Improvement Proposals (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/cips/" target="_blank">CIPs</a>).

The main focus of this meeting was dedicated to the topic of multiple graphs, with an emphasis on syntax and semantics.
Additionally, a proposal was presented for the integration of graph query procedures (written in a graph query language) into SQL.
