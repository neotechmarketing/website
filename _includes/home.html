        <div class="content">
            <p>
                openCypher is an open source implementation of Cypher® - the most widely adopted, fully-specified, and open query language for property graph
                databases. Cypher was developed by <a href='https://neo4j.com/'>Neo4j®</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cypher provides an intuitive way to work with property graphs today and is the best on-ramp to <a
                    href="https://www.gqlstandards.org/">the graph
                query language (GQL) standard being developed by ISO</a>.

                    <p>
                    The <a href="https://neo4j.com/blog/gql-international-standard/">GQL ISO standard has landed</a> (April 11, 2024), marking a historical moment for graph database languages and a huge milestone in what has already been a relatively long history of language development.

                    In his <a href="https://neo4j.com/blog/opencypher-gql-cypher-implementation/">blog post</a>, Valerio Malenchino describes a vision of the openCypher project’s future in what will soon become a GQL world.

            <p>
                The openCypher Implementers Group consists of openCypher implementers/vendors who collectively seek to
            <li>Ensure consistency between implementations of openCypher</li>
            <li>Maintain and bugfix the openCypher query language</li>
            <li>Transition planning from openCypher implementations to the developing graph query language standard,
                GQL
            </li>
            </p>
            <p>
                Members of the openCypher Implementers Group include Spark, RedisGraph, AnzoGraph, and Neo4j, <a

        <div class="content">
            <p>
            <li>openCypher is an open-source project that makes it easy to use the Cypher language in order to
                incorporate graph processing capabilities within that product or application.
            </li>
            <li>Originally contributed by Neo4j, openCypher is now used by over 10 products and tens of thousands of
                developers.
            </li>
            <li>Easy-to-learn and human-readable, Cypher is suitable for developers, data scientists and operations
                professionals alike.
            </li>
            <li>Cypher lets users simply express what data to retrieve (declarative) while the underlying engine
                completes the task without requiring they understand implementation details.
            </li>
            <li>Cypher is a key inspiration for <a href="https://www.gqlstandards.org/">the ISO project creating a
                standard graph query language</a>.
